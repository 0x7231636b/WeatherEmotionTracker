# WeatherEmotionTracker

This project is used to store weather data of each day. Not only is the temperature important but the overall condition needs to be tracked like humidity, wind speed, rain/snow fall intensity, even the frequency could be measured if needed.

The emotion part is the perception of the user of the weather. How does the weather feel? Uncomfortable? Pleasant? When having enough data points we can compare everything to check if the weather feeling was correct or if the weather was in general not too bad but the users feelings were off.

This comparison helps to determine when the user is feeling the weather correctly and when not. When the user isn't feeling the weather "correctly" we know that the weather is just used as a projection of the feelings. When having enough data we can offer a suggestion to the user to check if the weather is really the reason for the bad mood or if there is something else going on. This helps from a psychological point of view to understand oneself better and to be careful with the own feelings and when to specifically listen to the own mood and emotions and when it is maybe not that important because the weather is just really uncomfortable (subjectively and objectively).
